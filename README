Original code from JeeLabs http://news.jeelabs.org/code/

forked by Adafruit

and then forked by me... rlameiro :D

Now forked by me xxxajk.
What's new:
All the standard libc time functions are available, but Epoch is 1/1/1900, and time_t is int64_t.
I2C is protected by xmem's multitasking lock if you use multitasking.
You no longer have to 'start' the RTC with begin, or even declare that you use it.
If you are missing the DS1307, the library automatically reverts to using software RTC.
There are 3 simplified functions for using the RTC library.
        Set the time
                RTCset(const DateTime& dt);
        Get the current time
                DateTime RTCnow();
        Find out if RTC is hardware.
                boolean RTChardware(void);

Notes for users in the far future.
In the year 2100 you will have to get a new DS1307 and adjust the software because the DS1307 is only
good to the year 2099. :-)
